# Neural-Network

Simple numpy only neural network trained on the MNIST dataset.

Run Training.py to train it on 10 epochs of 64 images. Records between 90% - 99% accuracy typically.

Run predict_image.py to have it display the image it's looking at and then exit the plot
to have it print in the terminal the results of its prediction.
